# ðŸ”±   Trident-Search (for Federated Histology Slide Feature Extraction and Retrieval)
 
Trident-Search is a toolkit based on the [original TRIDENT repository](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TRIDENT), simplified for slide-level feature extraction and federated histology slide search.

This project was developed by the [Mahmood Lab](https://faisal.ai/) at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. This work was funded by NIH NIGMS R35GM138216.

### ðŸ”¨ 1. **Installation**:
- Create an environment: `conda create -n "trident_search" python=3.10`, and activate it `conda activate trident`.
- Local installation: `pip install -e .`.

### ðŸ”¨ 2. **Running Trident for TITAN Inference**:

**Already familiar with WSI processing?** Perform segmentation, patching, and TITAN slide feature extraction from a directory of WSIs with:

```
python run_batch_of_slides.py --task all --wsi_dir ./wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --patch_encoder titan --mag 20 --patch_size 512
```

**Using TITAN for a single slide**

Run this command to perform segmentation, patching, and TITAN slide-level feature extraction for:

1. A single slide
```bash
SLIDE_PATH=./wsis/xxxx.svs
OUTPUT_DIR=./trident_single_processed

python run_single_slide.py \
 --slide_path $SLIDE_PATH \
 --job_dir $OUTPUT_DIR \
 --slide_encoder titan \
 --mag 20 --patch_size 512
```

2. A directory of slides
```bash
SLIDE_DIR=./wsis
OUTPUT_DIR=./trident_batch_processed

python run_batch_of_slides.py \
 --task all \
 --wsi_dir $SLIDE_DIR \
 --job_dir $OUTPUT_DIR \
 --slide_encoder titan \
 --mag 20 --patch_size 512
```

**Further Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**Step 1: Tissue Segmentation:** Segments tissue vs. background from a dir of WSIs
 - **Command**:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_of_slides.py --task seg --wsi_dir ./wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --gpu 0 --segmenter grandqc
   ```
   - `--task seg`: Specifies that you want to do tissue segmentation.
   - `--wsi_dir ./wsis`: Path to dir with your WSIs.
   - `--job_dir ./trident_processed`: Output dir for processed results.
   - `--gpu 0`: Uses GPU with index 0.
   - `--segmenter`: Segmentation model. Defaults to `grandqc` for fast H&E segmentation. Add the option `--remove_artifacts` for additional artifact clean up.
 - **Outputs**:
   - WSI thumbnails in `./trident_processed/thumbnails`.
   - WSI thumbnails with tissue contours in `./trident_processed/contours`.
   - GeoJSON files containing tissue contours in `./trident_processed/contours_geojson`. These can be opened in [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) for editing/quality control, if necessary.

 **Step 2: Tissue Patching:** Extracts patches from segmented tissue regions at a specific magnification.
 - **Command**:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_of_slides.py --task coords --wsi_dir ./wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --mag 20 --patch_size 512 --overlap 0
   ```
   - `--task coords`: Specifies that you want to do patching.
   - `--wsi_dir wsis`: Path to the dir with your WSIs.
   - `--job_dir ./trident_processed`: Output dir for processed results.
   - `--mag 20`: Extracts patches at 20x magnification.
   - `--patch_size 512`: Each patch is 512x512 pixels.
   - `--overlap 0`: Patches overlap by 0 pixels (**always** an absolute number in pixels, e.g., `--overlap 128` for 50% overlap for 256x256 patches.
 - **Outputs**:
   - Patch coordinates as h5 files in `./trident_processed/20x_512px/patches`.
   - WSI thumbnails annotated with patch borders in `./trident_processed/20x_512px/visualization`.

 **Step 3a: Patch Feature Extraction:** Extracts features from tissue patches using a specified encoder
 - **Command**:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_of_slides.py --task feat --wsi_dir ./wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --patch_encoder conch_v15 --mag 20 --patch_size 512
   ```
   - `--task feat`: Specifies that you want to do feature extraction.
   - `--wsi_dir wsis`: Path to the dir with your WSIs.
   - `--job_dir ./trident_processed`: Output dir for processed results.
   - `--patch_encoder conch_v15`: Uses the  **CONCHv1.5** patch encoder. See below for list of supported models. 
   - `--mag 20`: Features are extracted from patches at 20x magnification.
   - `--patch_size 512`: Patches are 512x512 pixels in size.
 - **Outputs**: 
   - Features are saved as h5 files in `./trident_processed/20x_256px/features_conch_v15`. (Shape: `(n_patches, feature_dim)`)

This deployment of TRIDENT (specialized for **TITAN** inference) supports the following patch encoders, loaded via `./trident/patch_encoder_models/load.py`. The **CONCHv1.5** model checkpoint is made available in the local path: `./trident/patch_encoder_models/model_zoo/conchv1_5/pytorch_model_vision.bin`. Other models can be made available upon request.

- **UNI**: [MahmoodLab/UNI](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/UNI)  (`--patch_encoder uni_v1 --patch_size 256 --mag 20`)
- **UNIv2**: [MahmoodLab/UNI2-h](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/UNI2-h)  (`--patch_encoder uni_v2 --patch_size 256 --mag 20`)
- **CONCH**: [MahmoodLab/CONCH](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/CONCH)  (`--patch_encoder conch_v1 --patch_size 512 --mag 20`)
- **CONCHv1.5**: [MahmoodLab/conchv1_5](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/conchv1_5)  (`--patch_encoder conch_v15 --patch_size 512 --mag 20`)

**Step 3b: Slide Feature Extraction:** Extracts slide embeddings using  **TITAN** as the slide encoder. Choosing **TITAN** will automatically select the **CONCHv1.5** as the patch encoder to extract features (if not already extracted). The **TITAN** model checkpoint is made available in the local path: `./trident/slide_encoder_models/model_zoo/titan/pytorch_model_vision.bin`

 - **Command**:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_of_slides.py --task feat --wsi_dir ./wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --slide_encoder titan --mag 20 --patch_size 512 
   ```
   - `--task feat`: Specifies that you want to do feature extraction.
   - `--wsi_dir wsis`: Path to the dir containing WSIs.
   - `--job_dir ./trident_processed`: Output dir for processed results.
   - `--slide_encoder titan`: Uses the `Titan` slide encoder. See below for supported models.
   - `--mag 20`: Features are extracted from patches at 20x magnification.
   - `--patch_size 512`: Patches are 512x512 pixels in size.
 - **Outputs**: 
   - Features are saved as h5 files in `./trident_processed/20x_512px/slide_features_titan`. (Shape: `(feature_dim)`)
